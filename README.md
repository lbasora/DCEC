# Deep Clustering with Convolutional Autoencoders (DCEC)

Fork from https://github.com/XifengGuo/DCEC.git 

Adaptation of DCEC to the clustering of air traffic trajectories for the [traffic](https://github.com/xoolive/traffic) library.

Implemented with keras and tensorflow 2.

Make sure to properly install:
- traffic
- keras + tensorflow (or tensorflow-gpu) 2.0 or greater: 

  To install tensorflow-gpu 2.0 and related cuda libraries (cudatoolkit 10.0 & cudnn 7.6), it is easier to use conda: `conda install tensorflow-gpu`

- [artefact](https://github.com/xoolive/artefact) (only for notebook plots)
